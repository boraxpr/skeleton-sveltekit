Installation

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server will be running on port 3000 because the default port is configured in the package.json > dev > vite --port 3000. This port configuration is necessary due to the CORS protection setup in the API used in the project.

## Features

/todo : Displays a table that fetches data from an API using server-side rendering (SSR) to prevent API endpoint leaks to the client.
